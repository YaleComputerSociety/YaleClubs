Berkeley is particularly committed to a pedagogy and a formation program devoted to social justice and racial reconciliation.\n\nAs a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, Berkeley offers an excellent education in the Episcopal tradition that complements the larger academic program of Yale Divinity School. Students enrolled in Berkeley Divinity School typically graduate with either a diploma or certificate in Anglican Studies and go on to serve in ordained capacities in The Episcopal Church or other parts of the Anglican Communion as parish clergy; as school, college, and hospital chaplains; or in other positions of pastoral responsibility. Some graduates pursue lay vocations both within and outside the church, and others go on to further graduate education and academic careers.

At the same time, we acknowledge the fraught and beautiful complexity of \"shared ground,\" and thus commit to grappling with and addressing the ongoing legacies of colonization, patriarchy, and racism. We are guided and inspired by scientific and traditional knowledge, including the practices of indigenous peoples who have stewarded these lands for millenia, which now comprise the city of New Haven, and the many saints, mystics, and practitioners of different faiths who have called on us to love and care for our one earth home. Additionally, we aim to provide environmental visibility to issues on campus, holding YDS accountable to our unique calling as an institution: to put faith and scholarship into action for the common good of all persons, beings, and ecosystems. Activities include: potlucks, volunteer opportunities, Earth-based ceremonies, environmental education, supporting other groups, rallies, petitions, nonviolent direct action, etc.",

For over 40 years, first-year students have participated in an exciting week of engaging activities intended to facilitate their transition to Yale alongside their peers, CC counselors, and many members of the Yale staff. Activities include discussions with faculty experts about ethnicity, nationality, and race; panels on academic expectations by faculty; presentations on campus life by students; and group visits to local points of interest such as the Yale College cultural centers, local and University museums and parks.\n\"Without CC, I wouldn't know the Yale that I know.

    "category": null,
    "mission": "For a very long time, surgery was not included in the discussion of how healthcare could be improved worldwide, especially in the most remote corners of the earth. Only recently has surgery been brought to the table, being called the \"forgotten step-child\" of global health by Paul Farmer and many others. At the very core, global surgery is \"a field that aims to improve health and health equity for all who are affected by surgical conditions or have a need for surgical care, with a particular focus on underserved populations in countries of all income levels, as well as populations in crisis, such as those experiencing conflict, displacement, and disaster.\" Important to this effort is all aspects of surgery, including anesthesia, OB/Gyn, and nursing.\n\nCurrently, 5 billion people around the world do not have adequate access to basic surgical care. Worse yet, the disparity in surgical care is stark, with the poorest 30% of the world receives only 3-6% of operations, whereas the richest 30% receives almost 75%. 17 million people die and 77 million DALYS are lost each year because of this, greater than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB combined. Our global economy could lose 21 trillion dollars between 2015 and 2030, with 12.3 trillion lost by low- and middle-income countries, so the lack of surgical care worldwide is also a significant detriment to the progress of humanity. 2.2 million more surgeons, anesthetists, and OB/Gyns (SAOs) and an investment of $350 billion dollars is needed to prevent this from happening, with a goal to raise the operative volume of countries to 5,000 per 100,000 population, meaning an increase of 143 million more surgical procedures per year. It can be easy to get lost in the numbers, but ultimately, health is a human right, and no one should have to live with a condition that would have been treated had they been born somewhere else.\n\nSo the bigger question becomes how we address this need for surgical care. In the past, this has almost exclusively involved efforts such as week-long surgical missions and the provision of money/resources in order to acutely work on the problem. However, the field has evolved with the creation of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, which called for a more in-depth analysis. Their major report from spring 2015 outlined an approach through investigation, innovation, and implementation, pointing out that research, technology, and capacity-building efforts were necessary to advance the field. In addition, they did a thorough economic analysis which showed that upscaling the number of surgeons and operations alone will not work - an economic approach that helps decrease catastrophic health expenditure for patients and their families is necessary. As the Lancet Commission encompasses almost 110 different countries, efforts have now been set on working at the highest level - with governments, health ministers, and financial officers - to enact changes in policy and infrastructure for whole countries to improve people's access to surgical care.\n\nUltimately, whether you are interested in surgery/anesthesia/OBGyn, global/public health, economics/finance, policy, technology/engineering, education/empowerment, statistics/research, or any combination of these, you have a very significant contribution to make to this growing field. And no matter how young or old you are, no matter how little or how much you can contribute, your involvement in global surgery is incredibly necessary and valuable.\n*Reference: Meara, J, Leather A, Hagander L, et al.

However, much more is accomplished—students learn skills that have immediate practical use, they are challenged physically to reach goals and mentally to endure hardships, and learn they can accomplish more than they thought. Students come together and form a tight bond of lasting friendships, and they create a close group that supports them during the oncoming years.\nGoals of the leaders are to create an atmosphere of trust and inclusiveness, and to ensure the safety and well being of each freshman.  It is the mission of FOOT for students get in touch with themselves and the great outdoors in the wonderful wilderness of the Northeast.  In addition to the focus on freshmen, FOOT is a proven leadership training program for its leaders.  After undergoing our leader training sessions and leading trips, FOOT Leaders can apply the skills they have learned to almost any situation or career choice that involves problem solving, critical thinking and empathy for others.",

We aim to make contributions to the further promotion of the chemical biology field, and help scientists within or without this field better understand what the field entails and its potential to contribute to the frontiers of science. ICBS-Yale is dedicated to educating academics about chemical biology, starting locally with the Yale community, and then expanding to the greater New England area, working together with the ICBS-Boston Chapter.\n\nMission 2: Appreciate\nAs the chemical biology field starts to gain more appreciation, many academic institutions are looking to expand in this area. However, it has been noticed that graduate and post-doctoral trainees in chemical biology might still be at disadvantage and sometimes overlooked during job hunting due to the lack of robust understanding of this new field. ICBS-Yale will make efforts to garner more respect and appreciation for this discipline, hoping to bring trainees tremendous benefits in their future career development.\n\nMission 3: Bridge\nICBS-Yale is dedicated to better bridging the siloed worlds of trainees in the biological and biomedical sciences and trainees in chemistry. We aim to foster communication, collaboration, and community between these disparate research areas.\n\nMission 4: Connect\nICBS-Yale aims to build stronger connections between academia and industry, and thus provide professional resources to chemical biology trainees, as well as to those who conduct scientific research at the interface between chemistry and biological & biomedical sciences. Yale-based biotech startup companies and therapeutic innovation efforts launched by Yale faculties will also be exploited as tremendous resources within the Yale community, which could be more accessible for Yale trainees.\n\nMission 5: Develop\nAs a summary of all previously listed missions and purposes, ICBS-Yale is dedicated to the career development of Yale chemical biology trainees, as well as to those who conduct scientific research at the interface between chemistry and biological & biomedical sciences.",

Beyond that, though, we also pay attention to the rising number of people in Western society who have a lively interest in spirituality but feel no connection to traditional forms of church and worship. So Marquand is also actively engaged in original, creative, and experimental forms of worship, both for committed Christians and for those exploring the faith.\nAttend Marquand five days in a row, and you may encounter an orthodox liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a Mardi Gras worship party, a service of silent Lenten contemplation, a chapel converted into one of Dante's spheres of heaven, or a worship café. As a student at Yale Divinity School, you may well have taken part in designing one of these services.\nFrom traditional worship to brave experiment, from ancient liturgy to post-modern praise, from the heart of America to global worship, Marquand's mission is to be worshipful, educational, and ecumenical, and we look forward to welcoming you here.\nServices take place in Marquand every weekday classes are in session. All services are open to the community.\nFor more information, contact marquand@yale.edu.",

In addition to outreach performances, we seek to provide informal music classes (covering instrumental/vocal instruction as well as general music theory classes) to children in the New Haven community. Members will design a music curriculum, which will be implemented at after-school workshops at elementary schools and social enrichment programs such as L.E.A.P.

It also brings critical human rights discussion to the wider university community. At the same time, it provides a forum for international human rights practitioners to consider the theoretical issues their work entails and for scholars studying human rights to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue. In addressing these needs, the Schell Center seeks to increase knowledge and understanding of international human rights issues; to equip lawyers and other professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to advance the cause of international human rights; and to assist human rights organizations.\nThe Schell Center coordinates a diverse program of human rights activities that serve students and scholars at Yale and contribute to the development of the human rights community locally and internationally.  The Center:\nSponsors frequent panels, lectures, and conferences, including the weekly Human Rights Workshop: Current Issues and Events;\nPromotes activism through summer and post-graduate fellowships;\nSponsors visiting human rights scholars and practitioners;\nActs as a liaison between the Law School and the human rights community;\nAdvises students about human rights research and about job and career opportunities;\nFosters human rights activities throughout Yale University",

The Center is a unique institution dedicated to helping advance China's legal reforms, improving U.S.–China relations, and increasing understanding of China in the United States.\nIn interaction with research and teaching at Yale, the Paul Tsai China Center works collaboratively with a broad range of top experts in the Chinese government, universities, and civil society on concrete projects designed to have a positive practical impact. Our Center has an established track record in helping to further a broad range of legal reforms in China. Cooperative projects have focused particularly on issues of judicial reform, criminal justice reform, administrative and regulatory reform, and public interest law. Projects involve a range of activities, including workshops and seminars in the United States and China, research visits to Yale and to China, and books or articles by Chinese or U.S. scholars.\nThe Paul Tsai China Center also conducts research and convenes high-level Track II and Track 1.5 meetings on a broad range of U.S.–China foreign policy issues. The centerpiece of this work is the Dialogue on U.S.–China Relations, a thriving channel since 2012 for top U.S. and Chinese figures to develop and provide timely policy recommendations for both governments. The dialogue convenes carefully selected former officials and practitioners to work toward strategic and diplomatic innovation over the full range of issues in the U.S.–China relationship, with dual emphases on security and economic issues. The Center also hosts top Chinese and U.S. scholars and policy practitioners at Yale as guests and visiting scholars who produce original research and interact with the broader Yale community.\nIn 2016, Yale Law School received an extraordinary gift of $30 million in honor of its distinguished alumnus, the late Dr. Paul C. Tsai, '54 LL.M , '57 J.S.D., to support the continuing work of the China Center. This generous gift was given by Paul Tsai's son, Joseph C. Tsai, Yale College, B.A. '86; Yale Law School, J.D. '90. In recognition of this gift, the Center was renamed the Paul Tsai China Center.\nThe Director of the Paul Tsai China Center is Professor Paul Gewirtz. Prior to establishing the Center in 1999, Professor Gewirtz was on leave from Yale University from 1997–1998 and was a part of President Bill Clinton's administration, where he served as Special Representative for the Presidential Rule of Law Initiative at the U.S. Department of State. In that post, he developed and led the U.S.–China initiative to cooperate in the legal field that President Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin launched at their October 1997 Summit.",

We also offer support for graduate and postdoc teaching through classroom observations and one-on-one consultations, which allow new teachers to share challenges in a neutral space.  Graduate students and postdocs who want to do more intensive teaching development can pursue the Certificate in College Teaching Preparation (CCTP), the requirements for which include teaching, participating in workshops, observing others' teaching, and preparing a capstone teaching portfolio.  At the heart of our program is a group of 22 McDougal Teaching Fellows who run many of our workshops and manager classroom observations.  Other opportunities for graduate student development include the Associates in Teaching program, which allows a graduate student to teach as instructor of record in partnership with a faculty member, and the Teaching Innovation Projects grant, which invites fresh ideas for using digital tools in the classroom.  The Graduate Teaching Program also serves the teaching needs of individual departments, promotes faculty-student mentoring, and responds to emerging developments in research about teaching.",

Changing the context of healthcare involves:\n- Coexistence with western medicine\n- Decolonize understanding of health\n- Understand eastern medicine principles in the context of community and the ways in which it transcends healthcare\n- Acknowledge the body has various dimensions of well-being\n- Encourage mindfulness to enhance the relationship between spirit and body",

So when someone comes to you wanting to reduce their blood pressure or improve their insulin sensitivity--and they want to do more than just take medications--you can confidently help them explore a variety of evidence-based options. We plan to discuss research on physical activity, aerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise and how they affect many of the most common health maladies we're likely to encounter as healthcare providers. We also plan to lead hands-on workshops in the Harkness gym so that you can learn how to implement the research. We don't intend to train you to become personal trainers--doing so is beyond the purview of this endeavor--though we hope you'll be familiar enough with these ideas and methods so that you can make confident suggestions to patients. Of course, we also value your feedback, so if there's anything you'd like us to address, then please let us know and we can try to do so.",

The Center brings together leading experts and practitioners from the public and private sectors to address cutting-edge questions of health law and policy, and to train the next generation of top health lawyers, industry leaders, policymakers, and academics.\nThe Center was established to meet a critical need for a new academic and legal-professional discipline that responds to the rapidly evolving environment of health care and its centrality in the nation's economy and government. \"Health law\" as a field of study in law schools is a relatively new concept; it has yet to be embraced within the field of \"public law,\" alongside similar disciplines like labor law and environmental law. Among the few health law centers at U.S. law schools, the Solomon Center is unique in its focus on the government's role in health care as well as health care business and physicians and scientists themselves. The Solomon Center distinguishes itself by doing what Yale does best: focusing on law as a tool to affect governance, industry, and the academy at the highest levels.\nThe Center's programming includes many course offerings, both academic and experiential; career planning; academic research, policy work and litigation briefs; and numerous high profile panels and conferences that bring academic, government, and business leaders in health care to the Law School. We host a steady stream of academic visitors from all disciplines to enrich our programming and course offers, and we actively support student research, field work, and publications. Our work is highly interdisciplinary. Building on established relationships with the Yale School of Medicine, Yale Cancer Center, Yale-New Haven Hospital, Yale School of Management, and Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, the Center brings together all that Yale has to offer to make a difference both at Yale and beyond.",

One of the founding parties of the Yale Political Union, the IP is easily the Union's largest party and the only one that adheres to no specific ideology or political viewpoint; instead we aim to foster robust, open, and wide-ranging political discourse.\nOur weekly debates are open to the entire Yale community and address challenging political, cultural, and philosophical issues. Our debate format is easily accessible and relies on Robert's Rules of Order to ensure that all voices are heard and respected. We encourage everyone–the casual visitor and committed member alike–to ask tough questions, give speeches, and actively explore their own convictions. Recently, we have debated some of the following resolutions: Resolved: Kill the Death Penalty; Resolved: Hypocrisy is Not Immoral; Resolved: WikiLeaks is Good for America; Resolved: Go West, Young Man; and Resolved: Defund the Arts\nThe Independent Party's motto is \"Hear All Sides,\" and this is an imperative by which we live. At our debates, you will find bold expressions of opinions from across the political spectrum. One could say that the IP is home to libertarians, socialists, neo-conservatives, hard-line moderates, and almost everything in between–but in fact, we are a group of students who resist the claustrophobic categories of \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" popular in today's politics and reject the partisan pressures that demand adherence to a mass-produced political platform, in favor of intellectually honest and authentic approaches to forming and evaluating our worldviews. In the Independent Party we believe that openness of mind is the truest mark of genuine intelligence.\nAlong with our debates, the Independent Party hosts a wide variety of social events throughout the academic year. Whether watching a movie, arguing over drinks, or toasting at Mory's, IPsters are always having fun together. As we like to say, we take our ideas seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. The IP is one of the closest groups of friends you will find at Yale; the friendships formed in the IP stay with us forever.\nWe also go to New York City every semester to meet with prominent politicians, journalists, business people, artists, and media personalities. In recent semesters, we have meet with former New York Mayor Ed Koch, Obama Administration health care expert Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel, Editor-in-Chief of The New Atlantis Eric Cohen, CEO of the New York Public Library Tony Marx, UN Ambassador John Bolton, Historian Eric Foner, and the late William F. Buckley, Jr.\n\"Yale,\" George Pierson famously said, \"is at once a tradition, a company of scholars, a society of friends.\" The Independent Party is much the same. Please join us at one of our debates this Fall and learn firsthand what this party is all about.",

In concert with Yale Law School's active student organizations, we strive to create a community that supports every student.\nTo further this goal, the Title IX Working Group advises the law school administration on policies and advances efforts to improve campus climate and promote gender justice. We engage locally—fostering inclusive pedagogy and providing resources for survivors of sexual assault or harassment—and globally—researching and weighing in on national conversations about gender violence.\nIn the past few years, we've delivered results, including rolling out a law-school wide survey of sexual harassment and violence, making gender equity a focus point in biannual course evaluations, and creating a peer-lead program to offer support and informal resources to all students. We also meet regularly with faculty and administrators to discuss student concerns.\nIf you have and questions or concerns, or if you would like to join the Working Group, please contact one of the co-chairs of the Working Group: Grace Judge, Evan Walker-Wells, or Noelle Wyman",

Lawyers are using videos to present evidence, closing arguments, and victim-impact statements; advocates are making viral videos to advance public education campaigns; and scholars are debating ideas in a multimedia blogosphere.  Everyone's doing it.  But no one is really teaching it — or reflecting upon it.  We see training in visual advocacy — effectively evaluating and making arguments through videos and images — as a vital part of our legal education.\nThe Visual Law Project fosters a community of students invested in visual advocacy. We enable students to produce intellectually stimulating documentary films on legal issues to advance public debate. We organize an annual reading group centered on visual jurisprudence. We connect YLS students with innovative practitioners and thinkers through our speaker series. VLP operates both within and beyond the law school, and seeks to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects with graduate students in other programs.",

Thirty-six years later, the 13 singers of Whim n' Rhythm represent the best and most experienced female musicians of the senior class.\nEach year, Whim has continued to grow into a full-force presence on Yale's campus and on both the national and international stages. The group tours domestically and in the greater New England area yearly, visiting locations from New York and Los Angeles to Hong Kong and Cairo, and recently founded a full-fledged Alumnae Board to help build the group's legacy from beyond Yale's campus. Post-commencement, the group traditionally takes a five-to-seven week World Tour, hitting nearly every continent.\nProspective singers audition in the spring of their junior year to be tapped into Whim for their senior year the following fall.

The fellowship provides valuable professional experience for potential careers in higher education and non-profit organizations, particularly for recent graduates belonging to minority communities currently underrepresented in university administration.\nFellowships are full-time paid positions in the offices of university leaders, who take active interest in fellows' professional development. Fellows directly report to senior members of their offices and work with a variety of university staff, at all levels. Fellows most often combine day-to-day duties with responsibilities for specific projects that utilize their research abilities and other higher-level skills. Organizational and writing skills are particularly valuable, as is the ability to work well with multiple constituencies: staff of all kinds (clerical, technical, service, maintenance, managerial, and professional), faculty, alumni, and students.\nFellows meet regularly together, including for lunchtime conversation with the president, provost,  secretary, and other university leaders. These conversations about roles and responsibilities, and the career paths that led people into academic administration, give fellows a broad understanding of many facets of working in higher education.",

Through a robust series of musical activities, many Bands members work with and become serious performers, conductors, composers, arrangers, writers, archivists, historians, photographers, producers, choreographers, media producers, critics, and teachers. Band members develop and master these skills through service to the University, performing and producing commencement music, benefit concerts, university ceremonies, theater shows, international tours, reading sessions for classes, and special events.\nThe YPMB is one of twelve scatter-style marching bands in the country. What does this mean? Most marching bands spend their time on field spelling their name in script or making a swirly line formation while playing the complete works of Andrew Lloyd Webber. We perform halftime shows composed of comedy segments, during which we spell witty things on the field and play really cool rock music. Between formations we run around wildly (hence the clever name \"scatter band\"). For example: in the past we've done a sketch about the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein as a Yale professor, accompanied to \"It's Gonna Be Me\" and \"Live and Let Die,\" one in which we played the \"Godfather\" theme and dug up Jimmy Hoffa on the 30-yard-line (this was during our trip to Giants Stadium) and the unforgettable George W. Bush sketch, which involved a line of white-shirted bandies and the playing of Eric Clapton's \"Cocaine.\" We are also a pep band. During the winter we support Yale's hockey and basketball teams every weekend. This time of year often leads to playoff travel; we've been to Lake Placid, Ann Arbor, MI, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, and more. We are a mobile attack unit. If there's anywhere on the Yale campus (or, really, the East Coast - we're flexible) that needs some relief from pretension, we'll be there to provide.\nWe could go on for pages trying to tell you what we are. You'd be best off to show up and find out, really. You won't be disappointed.\nFor more, visit us here: https://bands.yalecollege.yale.edu/bands/yale-precision-marching-band/frequently-asked-questions",

Climate change is an environmental exposure (Dept. of Environmental Health Sciences) that can affect both infectious (Dept. of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases) and chronic (Dept. of Chronic Disease Epidemiology) diseases. Research about the relationship between climate change and health can involve sophisticated modeling (Dept. of Biostatistics and others). Behavioral change, mental health, and social justice are major concerns (Dept. of Social and Behavioral Sciences). Finally, health management expertise is needed to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies, and climate change involves thorny policy issues (Dept. of Health Policy and Management).",
