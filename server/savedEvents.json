    "description": "Zoom | Jan. 11 – Feb. 29 | 7:30 pm Eastern. . . . Luke's intro to the Book of Acts summarizes his whole 24-chapter Gospel — Jesus' birth, childhood, teaching, preaching, wonder-working, passion, death, and resurrection — as \"all that Jesus began to do and teach.\" (Acts 1.1) To our author, the brilliant life and ministry of Jesus was just the beginning — a start that the church would continue as Christ's body in the world. The well-told stories of Acts recount the ways a small group of Jewish men and women in Jerusalem grew and expanded to move the Way of Jesus into cities around the Mediterranean Sea and, ultimately, beyond. This class will offer a close reading of this fascinating and faith-forward account.. . . . The eight sessions will occur on January 11, 18, 25, February 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. After attending all eight sessions, participants will receive a Certificate of Participation.\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2204390",

This course is based on my book, always on: practicing faith in a new media landscape, which draws on the research of media scholars (e.g. Jenkins, Campbell, Rheingold, Baym), religious scholars (e.g. Volf, Tanner, Smith, Bass), and educators (e.g. Palmer, Freire, Brookfield) to equip people like you to lead communities toward flourishing in a new media landscape. Participants completing this course will gain:. . . . - Deeper understanding of the new media landscape, especially its theological and cultural implications. . - Space to explore, imagine, and reflect on hybrid ministry (online + in-person ministry). . - Practical ways to do hybrid ministry well. . - Concrete actions to help others flourish in a new media landscape. . . . *The cost of this class is on a sliding scale at $75, $125, and $175.

You may be feeling fresh out of resilience, creativity, and agility. This course will help you to lean into your expertise while attending to what matters most for ministry in a new media landscape.. . . . This course is based on my book, always on: practicing faith in a new media landscape, which draws on the research of media scholars (e.g. Jenkins, Campbell, Rheingold, Baym), religious scholars (e.g. Volf, Tanner, Smith, Bass), and educators (e.g. Palmer, Freire, Brookfield) to equip people like you to lead communities toward flourishing in a new media landscape. Participants completing this course will gain:. . . . - Deeper understanding of the new media landscape, especially its theological and cultural implications. . - Space to explore, imagine, and reflect on hybrid ministry (online + in-person ministry). . - Practical ways to do hybrid ministry well. . - Concrete actions to help others flourish in a new media landscape. . . . *The cost of this class is on a sliding scale at $75, $125, and $175. There is a limited number of full scholarships available. Contact Brandon Nappi here regarding scholarships.\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2260618",

    "description": "During this Brown Bag, Janice Willson and Elka KristoNagy from the CLS will be presenting on \"Neurodiversity and Language Instruction: Preparing for Student Success\". . Neurodiversity in the language classroom: how can we create a welcoming and barrier-free environment for all language learners? Studies have brought to light that language instructor training has lacked crucial aspects of neurodiversity support.  While many students are identified early in their education as having dyslexia and/or ADHD, there are students who have other hidden neurodivergences that might have been easily overlooked. How can we recognize and support students with a neurodivergence, including those who have already developed coping strategies or those who are unaware of their neurological difference? Moreover, if they can already cope, why should we address this? Because of the heavy impact of neurological differences on language learning and study skills, awareness and knowledge ought to be integral to a nuanced language instruction approach. This presentation will not only offer an overview of the concept of neurodiversity, but draw on examples from research on dyslexia, which we hope will provide insights into identifying factors of neurodiversity and aid in developing inclusive pedagogical practices. The usefulness of UDL (universal design for learning) for accessible instruction and assessment will be introduced with an update on campus resources available to support busy language instructors.\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2261124",

    "summary": "YAAA Book Talk - Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution",
    "description": "Join the Yale African American Affinity Group for a conversation with Marlene Daut, professor of French and African American studies at Yale University, about her book Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution. Register by Friday, January 19th for your chance to win a free copy of the book!. . . . The Haitian Revolution was a powerful blow against colonialism and slavery. As its thinkers and fighters blazed the path to universal freedom, they forced anticolonial, antislavery, and antiracist ideals into modern political grammar. The first state in the Americas to permanently abolish slavery, outlaw color prejudice, and forbid colonialism, Haitians established their nation in a hostile Atlantic World. Slavery was ubiquitous throughout the rest of the Americas and foreign nations and empires repeatedly attacked Haitian sovereignty. Yet Haitian writers and politicians successfully defended their independence while planting the ideological roots of egalitarian statehood.. . . . In Awakening the Ashes, Marlene L. Daut situates famous and lesser-known eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Haitian revolutionaries, pamphleteers, and political thinkers within the global history of ideas, showing how their systems of knowledge and interpretation took center stage in the Age of Revolutions. While modern understandings of freedom and equality are often linked to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man or the US Declaration of Independence, Daut argues that the more immediate reference should be to what she calls the 1804 Principle that no human being should ever again be colonized or enslaved, an idea promulgated by the Haitians who, against all odds, upended French empire.\n\nMeeting Link: https://yale.zoom.us/j/98966821681?pwd=aEVvemtwdHQ4K2VIazlkaGV6TENnUT09\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2260754",

    "description": "Despite their very recent appearance in the realm of education, Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are already having a profound impact on how educators design and plan lessons and classroom materials. ChatGPT, defined by Qadir (2023) as “a generative AI that is designed to be able to generate new content or ideas and express it in real-time conversations,” (p. 1), can be used for several language learning and teaching purposes, from the creation of syllabi and lesson plans to the generation of texts on different topics and at different Lexile levels. In this interactive workshop I will demonstrate how participants can use ChatGPT and other generative AI tools to enhance their language teaching and their students' language learning. I will demonstrate several features of ChatGPT and encourage participants to try these features on their own. Participants will engage in activities such as generating texts for different proficiency levels, making language quizzes, explaining difficult language concepts, and empowering students to take ownership of their language learning. We will also discuss how educators and learners can get the most out of ChatGPT and generative AI while still adhering to ethical classroom practices. \n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2261381",

    "description": "Assessment can often be one of the most challenging aspects of a course,  and it is made all the more difficult now that AI is so readily available. How can we rethink our assessments to account for the rise of AI, while resisting  punitive change and prioritizing our learning goals? One potential solution is to consider alternatives to the end-of-term paper, which students may find more authentic and creative. Our conversation will begin with insights from Catherine Panter-Brick, the Bruce A. and Davi-Ellen Chabner Professor of Anthropology, Health, and Global Affairs, and Thomas Harris, Professor in the Practice Yale Film and Media Studies & African American Studies. They will share their own thoughts and pedagogical practices and then invite others into the conversation. Participants are encouraged to come ready to contribute their own questions, challenges, and variations on practices related to alternative forms of assessment. Lunch will be provided. We are committed to hosting inclusive and accessible events that allow all participants to fully engage. Please contact us at faculty.teaching@yale.edu if there are ways we can support accommodations, be aware of any dietary restrictions, or for questions about inclusion.\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2261192",

Catching courage and hope from the stories we tell of beloved saints—both conventional and unconventional—who have faced challenges and managed to stay rooted in joy, justice, and the beloved community is enormously helpful. Stories are how we and the young people in our lives imagine how things could be, and discover what it takes to make positive change.. . . . Join author Daneen Akers and Christian educator Wendy Claire Barrie as they talk about progressive faith formation especially through the lens of the middle-grades anthology Holy Troublemakers & Unconventional Saints and its companion curriculum. Hear ideas for how the stories of people like Bayard Rustin, Wangari Maathai, Thich Nhat Hahn, Mr. Rogers, Valarie Kaur, Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, Rev. Gafney, Rumi, and more can connect with adolescents. There will be time for break-out sessions and sample curriculum.

However, it can often be difficult to find ways to effectively engage students in large lecture courses. How can we mitigate these challenges and foster active participation in our classrooms? Our conversation will begin with insights from Woo-kyoung Ahn, the John Hay Whitney Professor of Psychology, and Stepen Slade, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science. They will share their own thoughts and pedagogical practices and then invite others into the conversation. Participants are encouraged to come ready to contribute their own questions, challenges, and variations on practices related to engagement in large lecture courses. Breakfast will be provided. We are committed to hosting inclusive and accessible events that allow all participants to fully engage. Please contact us at faculty.teaching@yale.edu if there are ways we can support accommodations, be aware of any dietary restrictions, or for questions about inclusion.\n---\nEvent Details: https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/rsvp?id=2261193",
