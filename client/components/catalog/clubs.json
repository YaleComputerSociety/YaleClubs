Africa.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"kab275","upi":24816799,"email":"khayr.barry@yale.edu","mailbox":"kab275@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"KhaYr","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Barry","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":"https://us-nc-recordings.s3.amazonaws.com/recording_4220f6296d5824b7ec57708ab83f3b50.mp3","school_code":"FS","school":"School

As the only Mexican folk dance group on campus, Ballet Folklórico does not hold auditions.

Berkeley is particularly committed to a pedagogy and a formation program devoted to social justice and racial reconciliation.\n\nAs a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, Berkeley offers an excellent education in the Episcopal tradition that complements the larger academic program of Yale Divinity School. Students enrolled in Berkeley Divinity School typically graduate with either a diploma or certificate in Anglican Studies and go on to serve in ordained capacities in The Episcopal Church or other parts of the Anglican Communion as parish clergy; as school, college, and hospital chaplains; or in other positions of pastoral responsibility. Some graduates pursue lay vocations both within and outside the church, and others go on to further graduate education and academic careers. The School's graduates consistently achieve excellent results on the General Ordination Exams and enjoy a strong placement record in full-time employment or further educational programs within a year of graduation.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"hb582","upi":24882402,"email":"hannah.black@yale.edu","mailbox":"hb582@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":"Assistant Director – Leadership & Communications","first_name":"Hannah","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Black","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":null,"school":null,"year":null,"curriculum":null,"college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":"409 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511","access_code":null,"organization_code":"DIV","organization":"Divinity School","unit_class":"DIVFIN","unit_code":"CC1166","unit":"Divinity General","postal_address":"Divinity School, PO BOX 208313, New Haven, CT 06520-8313","office_building":"Sterling Div.

Statement: Common Ground is a student group at YDS that invites anyone and everyone to the shared work of caring for the Earth, our common ground. Description: Common Ground is a faith-based, student-led group that aims to build community around caring for and celebrating our communal home. Through platforms of community building, education, and advocacy, Common Ground will provide a space for people to come together to respond to and reckon with environmental issues, giving particular attention to the climate emergency. We seek to deepen our relationships to one another and the ground we share through exploring reparative work rooted in faith, community, diversity, and celebration. At the same time, we acknowledge the fraught and beautiful complexity of \"shared ground,\" and thus commit to grappling with and addressing the ongoing legacies of colonization, patriarchy, and racism. We are guided and inspired by scientific and traditional knowledge, including the practices of indigenous peoples who have stewarded these lands for millenia, which now comprise the city of New Haven, and the many saints, mystics, and practitioners of different faiths who have called on us to love and care for our one earth home. Additionally, we aim to provide environmental visibility to issues on campus, holding YDS accountable to our unique calling as an institution: to put faith and scholarship into action for the common good of all persons, beings, and ecosystems. Activities include: potlucks, volunteer opportunities, Earth-based ceremonies, environmental education, supporting other groups, rallies, petitions, nonviolent direct action, etc.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"khh25","upi":24799986,"email":"kelli.hata@yale.edu","mailbox":"kelli.hata@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Kelli","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Hata","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"DI","school":"Divinity School","year":2025,"curriculum":"Religion and Ecology","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"DIV","organization":"Divinity School","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"acb244","upi":24578544,"email":"caroline.blosser@yale.edu","mailbox":"caroline.blosser@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Caroline","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Blosser","suffix":null,"pronouns":"she/her","phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":"https://us-nc-recordings.s3.amazonaws.com/recording_be8f94cb337126ad39a50a26b1e10b63.mp3","school_code":"DI","school":"Divinity School","year":2024,"curriculum":"Ministry, Professional","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"DIV","organization":"Divinity School","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"kc2258","upi":24324734,"email":"kaley.casenhiser@yale.edu","mailbox":"kaley.casenhiser@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Kaley","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Casenhiser","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"DI","school":"Divinity School","year":2024,"curriculum":"Ministry, Professional","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"DIV","organization":"Divinity School","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"rm2546","upi":24542742,"email":"ross.martin@yale.edu","mailbox":"rm2546@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Ross","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Martin","suffix":null,"pronouns":"He/ him/his","phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":"https://us-nc-recordings.s3.amazonaws.com/recording_ae997ad8f57041fb3a07e10e6d3f47c8.mp3","school_code":"GS","school":"Graduate School of Arts & Sciences","year":2029,"curriculum":"Environment","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":null,"organization":null,"unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null}]},{"id":34349,"name":"Communication and Consent Educators","type":"Yale College Dean's Office Administration","category":"Administrative","email":"cce@yale.edu","website":"https://cce.yalecollege.yale.edu/","phone":null,"logo":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/upload/yale/2020/s2_image_upload_1466067_jhml2vxo_400x400_1_0_424102356.png","address":null,"mission":"The Communication and Consent Educators (CCEs) are a large, diverse group of undergraduates working together to foster a more positive sexual and social climate on campus.

Our debates tend to address issues of particular interest to American conservatives, including economics, religion, family, culture, foreign policy, and—true to our name—federalism. Our Party pays homage to the original Federalists—Hamilton, Madison, and Jay—and to their astute perception of human nature and good governance as illustrated in the Federalist Papers. These men understood that laws and norms may change with the times, but arbitrary intervention in the process is a short and nasty route to social caducity. When a people begin to think that they can improve society infinitely by incessant alteration of the legal and moral order, nothing remains settled, and every dear attachment, every right, and every bit of property are endangered.\nThe ladies and gentlemen of our Party hail from many backgrounds and schools of thought but are bound together by a shared pursuit of the truth. You will find that the friendships forged in that pursuit are neither geographically nor temporally bound as we are always seeking to know not merely what is most efficient, fair or equal, but what is right and good. Outside of debates Federalists spend time together over meals, toasting sessions, movie nights, basketball games, and other impromptu gatherings. We also host several conservative guest speakers throughout the year.","constitution":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/get_file?eid=a8163933dea61bd926c2eb1282902ba7","leaders":[{"netid":"eav49","upi":24818499,"email":"emma.ventresca@yale.edu","mailbox":"emma.ventresca@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Emma","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Ventresca","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"YC","school":"Yale

We aim to bring people together through shared cultural experiences, build community, and embrace all the various interpretations of what it means to be a Hong Konger.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/get_file?eid=7daefc9b38a7d84c560a0cb221e97c23","leaders":[{"netid":"eis22","upi":24299438,"email":"elven.shum@yale.edu","mailbox":"elven.shum@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Elven","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Shum","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"YC","school":"Yale College","year":2024,"curriculum":null,"college":"Davenport","college_code":"DC","leave":false,"visitor":false,"image":"https://yalestudentphotos.s3.amazonaws.com/b69e61831b30047d6a0baa11f9c5ea11.jpg","birthday":"Feb 2","birth_month":2,"birth_day":2,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":"Computer Science & Economics","address":"Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.A.R.","access_code":null,"organization_code":null,"organization":null,"unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"am3565","upi":24307955,"email":"alex.mclane@yale.edu","mailbox":"alex.mclane@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Alex","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"McLane","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"YC","school":"Yale College","year":2025,"curriculum":null,"college":"Berkeley","college_code":"BK","leave":false,"visitor":false,"image":"https://yalestudentphotos.s3.amazonaws.com/acf97bcbc7f6878f9ed2b1c18ac29a97.jpg","birthday":"Jan 6","birth_month":1,"birth_day":6,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":"History","address":"2419 Buckingham Ln\nLos Angeles, CA 90077-1335","access_code":null,"organization_code":null,"organization":null,"unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"ahp42","upi":24582420,"email":"alexandra.paulus@yale.edu","mailbox":"alexandra.paulus@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":"2034361459","fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Alexandra","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Paulus","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"YC","school":"Yale College","year":2025,"curriculum":null,"college":"Pierson","college_code":"PC","leave":false,"visitor":false,"image":"https://yalestudentphotos.s3.amazonaws.com/b36d2d8e596483021445cbee189f611f.jpg","birthday":"Jul 11","birth_month":7,"birth_day":11,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":"Chemistry","address":"134 E 93rd St Apt 9B\nNew York, NY 10128-1675","access_code":null,"organization_code":null,"organization":null,"unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null}]},{"id":35295,"name":"Hunger and Homelessness Action Project","type":"Yale College Undergraduate Organizations","category":"Advocacy/Policy, Service/Volunteering","email":"yhhap@dwighthall.org","website":"https://yhhap.org/","phone":null,"logo":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/upload/yale/2020/s2_image_upload_1648151_YHHAP_Square_Logo_815131219.png","address":null,"mission":"The Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project (YHHAP) is a student organization using education and action to alleviate housing and food insecurity in New Haven.

1: Educate\nAs a relatively new field, chemical biology has been growing tremendously over the past few years. We aim to make contributions to the further promotion of the chemical biology field, and help scientists within or without this field better understand what the field entails and its potential to contribute to the frontiers of science. ICBS-Yale is dedicated to educating academics about chemical biology, starting locally with the Yale community, and then expanding to the greater New England area, working together with the ICBS-Boston Chapter.\n\nMission 2: Appreciate\nAs the chemical biology field starts to gain more appreciation, many academic institutions are looking to expand in this area. However, it has been noticed that graduate and post-doctoral trainees in chemical biology might still be at disadvantage and sometimes overlooked during job hunting due to the lack of robust understanding of this new field. ICBS-Yale will make efforts to garner more respect and appreciation for this discipline, hoping to bring trainees tremendous benefits in their future career development.\n\nMission 3: Bridge\nICBS-Yale is dedicated to better bridging the siloed worlds of trainees in the biological and biomedical sciences and trainees in chemistry. We aim to foster communication, collaboration, and community between these disparate research areas.\n\nMission 4: Connect\nICBS-Yale aims to build stronger connections between academia and industry, and thus provide professional resources to chemical biology trainees, as well as to those who conduct scientific research at the interface between chemistry and biological & biomedical sciences. Yale-based biotech startup companies and therapeutic innovation efforts launched by Yale faculties will also be exploited as tremendous resources within the Yale community, which could be more accessible for Yale trainees.\n\nMission 5: Develop\nAs a summary of all previously listed missions and purposes, ICBS-Yale is dedicated to the career development of Yale chemical biology trainees, as well as to those who conduct scientific research at the interface between chemistry and biological & biomedical sciences.","benefits":"Akin to Cancer Immunotherapy, the awarding of the Nobel Prize has popularized this rapidly evolving field.

Divinity School and the Institute of Sacred Music, under the leadership of the Dean of Chapel and a team of staff and students.\nWorship in Marquand often draws on a wide variety of inherited Christian traditions, with the worship of many denominations being represented. Beyond that, though, we also pay attention to the rising number of people in Western society who have a lively interest in spirituality but feel no connection to traditional forms of church and worship. So Marquand is also actively engaged in original, creative, and experimental forms of worship, both for committed Christians and for those exploring the faith.\nAttend Marquand five days in a row, and you may encounter an orthodox liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a Mardi Gras worship party, a service of silent Lenten contemplation, a chapel converted into one of Dante's spheres of heaven, or a worship café. As a student at Yale Divinity School, you may well have taken part in designing one of these services.\nFrom traditional worship to brave experiment, from ancient liturgy to post-modern praise, from the heart of America to global worship, Marquand's mission is to be worshipful, educational, and ecumenical, and we look forward to welcoming you here.\nServices take place in Marquand every weekday classes are in session. All services are open to the community.\nFor more information, contact marquand@yale.edu.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"mal238","upi":17284308,"email":"michael.macalintal@yale.edu","mailbox":"mal238@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":"Liturgical Minister/Chapel Communications Manager","first_name":"Michael","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Libunao-Macalintal","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":null,"school":null,"year":null,"curriculum":null,"college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":"409 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511","access_code":null,"organization_code":"DIV","organization":"Divinity School","unit_class":"DIVFIN","unit_code":"CC1166","unit":"Divinity General","postal_address":"Divinity School, PO BOX 208313, New Haven, CT 06520-8313","office_building":"Sterling Div.

It also brings critical human rights discussion to the wider university community. At the same time, it provides a forum for international human rights practitioners to consider the theoretical issues their work entails and for scholars studying human rights to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue. In addressing these needs, the Schell Center seeks to increase knowledge and understanding of international human rights issues; to equip lawyers and other professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to advance the cause of international human rights; and to assist human rights organizations.\nThe Schell Center coordinates a diverse program of human rights activities that serve students and scholars at Yale and contribute to the development of the human rights community locally and internationally.  The Center:\nSponsors frequent panels, lectures, and conferences, including the weekly Human Rights Workshop: Current Issues and Events;\nPromotes activism through summer and post-graduate fellowships;\nSponsors visiting human rights scholars and practitioners;\nActs as a liaison between the Law School and the human rights community;\nAdvises students about human rights research and about job and career opportunities;\nFosters human rights activities throughout Yale University","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"eve4","upi":24818856,"email":"ebele.eseka@yale.edu","mailbox":"eve4@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Ebele","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Eseka","suffix":null,"pronouns":"she/her/hers","phonetic_name":"A-bay-lay","name_recording":"https://us-nc-recordings.s3.amazonaws.com/recording_db4291adf6b6bd994742b71e242857a7.mp3","school_code":"LW","school":"Law School","year":2025,"curriculum":"Law School","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"LAW","organization":"Law School","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"pbi5","upi":24849133,"email":"philsan.isaak@yale.edu","mailbox":"pbi5@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Philsan","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Isaak","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"LW","school":"Law School","year":2025,"curriculum":"Law School","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"LAW","organization":"Law School","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null},{"netid":"sls247","upi":17538084,"email":"shannon.sommers@yale.edu","mailbox":"sls247@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":"Postgraduate Associate","first_name":"Shannon","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":"Lindsey","last_name":"Sommers","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":null,"school":null,"year":null,"curriculum":null,"college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":"127 Wall Street, New Haven, CT 06511","access_code":null,"organization_code":"LAW","organization":"Law School","unit_class":"LAWCEN","unit_code":"CC1283","unit":"Orville H.

Topics for the SIG will cover sustainability in supply chains, innovations in materials, opportunities for justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in outdoor spaces, economic development in the rural United States, and others. Additionally, confronting racism both within Yale and in the outdoor recreation industry at large is central to the mission of ORec SIG. Additionally, ORec SIG notes that the ability of people across the country to enjoy time outside is enabled by land that was stolen from Indigenous peoples.\nORec SIG seeks student contributors to the \"New Directions in Outdoor Recreation\" publication, which showcases student writing on various aspects of the Outdoor Recreation Industry. https://medium.com/new-directions-in-outdoor-recreation-at-yale-fes","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[{"netid":"eem72","upi":24796059,"email":"esaac.mazengia@yale.edu","mailbox":"eem72@connect.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Esaac","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Mazengia","suffix":null,"pronouns":"He/Him","phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":"https://us-nc-recordings.s3.amazonaws.com/recording_25a540c5cfdb50b38b2bcd8428d455ea.mp3","school_code":"FS","school":"School of the Environment","year":2024,"curriculum":"MESc","college":null,"college_code":null,"leave":null,"visitor":null,"image":null,"birthday":null,"birth_month":null,"birth_day":null,"residence":null,"building_code":null,"entryway":null,"floor":null,"suite":null,"room":null,"major":null,"address":null,"access_code":null,"organization_code":"ENV","organization":"School of the Environment","unit_class":null,"unit_code":null,"unit":null,"postal_address":null,"office_building":null,"office_room":null,"cv":null,"profile":null,"website":null,"education":null,"publications":null}]},{"id":35817,"name":"OutLaws","type":"Yale Law School","category":"LGBTQ","email":"outlaws@yale.edu","website":"https://www.law.yale.edu/student-life/student-journals-organizations/student-organizations/outlaws","phone":null,"logo":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/upload/yale/2020/s2_image_upload_1454639_Only_Beauteous_25_428121512.png","address":null,"mission":"OutLaws is an organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) members of the Law School community.

The Center is a unique institution dedicated to helping advance China's legal reforms, improving U.S.–China relations, and increasing understanding of China in the United States.\nIn interaction with research and teaching at Yale, the Paul Tsai China Center works collaboratively with a broad range of top experts in the Chinese government, universities, and civil society on concrete projects designed to have a positive practical impact. Our Center has an established track record in helping to further a broad range of legal reforms in China. Cooperative projects have focused particularly on issues of judicial reform, criminal justice reform, administrative and regulatory reform, and public interest law. Projects involve a range of activities, including workshops and seminars in the United States and China, research visits to Yale and to China, and books or articles by Chinese or U.S. scholars.\nThe Paul Tsai China Center also conducts research and convenes high-level Track II and Track 1.5 meetings on a broad range of U.S.–China foreign policy issues. The centerpiece of this work is the Dialogue on U.S.–China Relations, a thriving channel since 2012 for top U.S. and Chinese figures to develop and provide timely policy recommendations for both governments. The dialogue convenes carefully selected former officials and practitioners to work toward strategic and diplomatic innovation over the full range of issues in the U.S.–China relationship, with dual emphases on security and economic issues. The Center also hosts top Chinese and U.S. scholars and policy practitioners at Yale as guests and visiting scholars who produce original research and interact with the broader Yale community.\nIn 2016, Yale Law School received an extraordinary gift of $30 million in honor of its distinguished alumnus, the late Dr. Paul C. Tsai, '54 LL.M , '57 J.S.D., to support the continuing work of the China Center. This generous gift was given by Paul Tsai's son, Joseph C. Tsai, Yale College, B.A. '86; Yale Law School, J.D. '90. In recognition of this gift, the Center was renamed the Paul Tsai China Center.\nThe Director of the Paul Tsai China Center is Professor Paul Gewirtz. Prior to establishing the Center in 1999, Professor Gewirtz was on leave from Yale University from 1997–1998 and was a part of President Bill Clinton's administration, where he served as Special Representative for the Presidential Rule of Law Initiative at the U.S. Department of State. In that post, he developed and led the U.S.–China initiative to cooperate in the legal field that President Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin launched at their October 1997 Summit.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[]},{"id":34411,"name":"Pauli Murray College","type":"Yale College Residential Colleges","category":"Residence

Through peer-to-peer education, engagement, and action, collaboration with academic and community partners, and learning from the women and femmes of color at the forefront of this movement, we work to progress access to all reproductive healthcare—birth control, abortion, and gender-affirming care included.\nWe recognize the intersectionality of this work and strive to also utilize a reproductive justice framework. Reproductive justice was developed in 1994 by the group \"Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice,\" and is defined as \"the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities\" (SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective).

Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School is the first of its kind to focus on the intersection of law and the governance, practice, and business of health care. The Center brings together leading experts and practitioners from the public and private sectors to address cutting-edge questions of health law and policy, and to train the next generation of top health lawyers, industry leaders, policymakers, and academics.\nThe Center was established to meet a critical need for a new academic and legal-professional discipline that responds to the rapidly evolving environment of health care and its centrality in the nation's economy and government. \"Health law\" as a field of study in law schools is a relatively new concept; it has yet to be embraced within the field of \"public law,\" alongside similar disciplines like labor law and environmental law. Among the few health law centers at U.S. law schools, the Solomon Center is unique in its focus on the government's role in health care as well as health care business and physicians and scientists themselves. The Solomon Center distinguishes itself by doing what Yale does best: focusing on law as a tool to affect governance, industry, and the academy at the highest levels.\nThe Center's programming includes many course offerings, both academic and experiential; career planning; academic research, policy work and litigation briefs; and numerous high profile panels and conferences that bring academic, government, and business leaders in health care to the Law School. We host a steady stream of academic visitors from all disciplines to enrich our programming and course offers, and we actively support student research, field work, and publications. Our work is highly interdisciplinary. Building on established relationships with the Yale School of Medicine, Yale Cancer Center, Yale-New Haven Hospital, Yale School of Management, and Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, the Center brings together all that Yale has to offer to make a difference both at Yale and beyond.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":null,"leaders":[]},{"id":35006,"name":"Something Extra","type":"Yale College Undergraduate Organizations","category":"Performance: Singing","email":"somethingextra.business@gmail.com","website":"http://www.somethingextrayale.com/","phone":null,"logo":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/upload/yale/2020/s2_image_upload_1649231_Something_Extra_Logojpg_72115495.jpeg","address":null,"mission":"Something Extra has historically showcased women's voices on a broad range of self-arranged musical compositions.

Black Solidarity Conference at Yale is a completely student-run annual conference held in February.  BSC is the largest undergraduate conference held at Yale University and it continues to grow each year! BSC invites over 700 undergraduates of of various races, religions, ethnicities, and communities to discuss issues pertaining to the African Diaspora. Through discussions, panels, networking, and social gatherings, students from across the country analyze issues affecting the Black/Afro-Diasporic community and explore solutions that can be implemented on their own college campuses.  In the past, the Conference has hosted Drs. Michael Eric Dyson, Angela Davis, Nikki Giovanni, and Cornel West as keynote speakers. We've also hosted artists such as J. Cole, Big Sean, Vic Mensa, and Phony Ppl as concert performers!

We aim to provide a physical and intellectual space where all are able to collaborate, learn, and unlearn without judgment. We strive to make our work accessible to everyone who wishes to engage with it, firmly believing that this work cannot and should not be done in isolation.\nThe Women's Center may be spatially enclosed within and funded by Yale, but all work within the university is intertwined with New Haven.

Within this rich environment, UP works exclusively with Yale undergraduates to ensure that their work gets the attention and support it needs. UP provides training and technical support for comedy, dance, music, opera, spoken word, theater, and interdisciplinary performance genres. We work on everything from large-scale projects, such as operas featuring dozens of cast members and musicians, to informal poetry slams.\nRegardless of scope and scale, all student productions must be planned and developed in a manner that ensures the safety of the production team and the audience. UP exists to fulfill this mandate as we support both the artistic vision and the highest level of safety for each undergraduate

We develop visual literacy within the YLS community and train law students to deploy visual content as a tool for advocacy.\nVisual and digital technologies have transformed the practice of law.  Lawyers are using videos to present evidence, closing arguments, and victim-impact statements; advocates are making viral videos to advance public education campaigns; and scholars are debating ideas in a multimedia blogosphere.  Everyone's doing it.  But no one is really teaching it — or reflecting upon it.  We see training in visual advocacy — effectively evaluating and making arguments through videos and images — as a vital part of our legal education.\nThe Visual Law Project fosters a community of students invested in visual advocacy. We enable students to produce intellectually stimulating documentary films on legal issues to advance public debate. We organize an annual reading group centered on visual jurisprudence. We connect YLS students with innovative practitioners and thinkers through our speaker series. VLP operates both within and beyond the law school, and seeks to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects with graduate students in other

of 1981, Yale's vibrant a cappella scene featured a dozen underclassman groups of every variety. However, seven senior women felt that a key part of their musical experience was missing – a senior group. These seven seniors founded Whim n' Rhythm as an answer to the decades-old tradition of The Whiffenpoofs. Thirty-six years later, the 13 singers of Whim n' Rhythm represent the best and most experienced female musicians of the senior class.\nEach year, Whim has continued to grow into a full-force presence on Yale's campus and on both the national and international stages. The group tours domestically and in the greater New England area yearly, visiting locations from New York and Los Angeles to Hong Kong and Cairo, and recently founded a full-fledged Alumnae Board to help build the group's legacy from beyond Yale's campus. Post-commencement, the group traditionally takes a five-to-seven week World Tour, hitting nearly every continent.\nProspective singers audition in the spring of their junior year to be tapped into Whim for their senior year the following fall. Whim represents nearly every underclassman singing group, a variety of residential colleges and academic majors, and hometowns ranging from coast to coast.","benefits":null,"goals":null,"constitution":"https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/get_file?eid=80bda2e8440f3db28787fc50b3451a12","leaders":[{"netid":"joo8","upi":24339218,"email":"julia.oladipo@yale.edu","mailbox":"julia.oladipo@bulldogs.yale.edu","phone":null,"fax":null,"title":null,"first_name":"Julia","preferred_name":null,"middle_name":null,"last_name":"Oladipo","suffix":null,"pronouns":null,"phonetic_name":null,"name_recording":null,"school_code":"YC","school":"Yale

Through the appointment of dedicated YBDIC fellows for each track in BBS, we aim to create more inclusive training environments throughout the BBS program – and we believe this will culminate into institutional change.\nThe student outreach division focuses on providing access to science education and science communication opportunities and resources, available at Yale and within Yale's networks, to engage, empower, and advance underrepresented, disadvantaged, and marginalized individuals in the biological and biomedical sciences to increase career readiness.\nThe student advancement division is committed to preparing underrepresented students in BBS to successfully navigate the next stage of their academic career and transition into non-academic or academic sectors. By creating a dedicated faculty mentoring network and leveraging our alumni relationships, we will be able to provide underrepresented students with models and mentors as they traverse the next stage of their academic career.

thriving cultural community. Its members are given opportunities to prepare and perform great music; learn about the arts and their place in society and international cultures; and develop skills to become leaders. Through a robust series of musical activities, many Bands members work with and become serious performers, conductors, composers, arrangers, writers, archivists, historians, photographers, producers, choreographers, media producers, critics, and teachers. Band members develop and master these skills through service to the University, performing and producing commencement music, benefit concerts, university ceremonies, theater shows, international tours, reading sessions for classes, and special events.\nThe YPMB is one of twelve scatter-style marching bands in the country. What does this mean? Most marching bands spend their time on field spelling their name in script or making a swirly line formation while playing the complete works of Andrew Lloyd Webber. We perform halftime shows composed of comedy segments, during which we spell witty things on the field and play really cool rock music. Between formations we run around wildly (hence the clever name \"scatter band\"). For example: in the past we've done a sketch about the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein as a Yale professor, accompanied to \"It's Gonna Be Me\" and \"Live and Let Die,\" one in which we played the \"Godfather\" theme and dug up Jimmy Hoffa on the 30-yard-line (this was during our trip to Giants Stadium) and the unforgettable George W. Bush sketch, which involved a line of white-shirted bandies and the playing of Eric Clapton's \"Cocaine.\" We are also a pep band. During the winter we support Yale's hockey and basketball teams every weekend. This time of year often leads to playoff travel; we've been to Lake Placid, Ann Arbor, MI, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, and more. We are a mobile attack unit. If there's anywhere on the Yale campus (or, really, the East Coast - we're flexible) that needs some relief from pretension, we'll be there to provide.\nWe could go on for pages trying to tell you what we are. You'd be best off to show up and find out, really. You won't be disappointed.\nFor more, visit us here:

We also like to talk to people in a friendly way! Treat people as your fellow human beings!\nCONSENT\nBoth on the dance floor and outside of it, we make sure to ask someone's consent before we do anything.

Accidents happen, but it doesn't mean someone doesn't have to apologize!\nIf anyone is uncomfortable during a dance, we encourage them to ask for more space, a lighter touch, or anything they need. If they don't feel safe, they can walk away from the dance. Please let an organizer know if they're feeling discomfort!\nIt's perfectly fine to turn down a dance. Be gracious and move on!\nCOLLABORATIVE WORK\nWe hope that everyone who finds these values awesome will share them!

Climate change is an environmental exposure (Dept. of Environmental Health Sciences) that can affect both infectious (Dept. of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases) and chronic (Dept. of Chronic Disease Epidemiology) diseases. Research about the relationship between climate change and health can involve sophisticated modeling (Dept. of Biostatistics and others). Behavioral change, mental health, and social justice are major concerns (Dept. of Social and Behavioral Sciences).
